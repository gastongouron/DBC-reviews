# Review Reflect And Iterate:

##Binary search & Sudoku

### About Binary search: Reviewing themncy
Based on [themcny binary search recursive code](https://github.com/sf-copperheads-2016/algorithm-drill-binary-search-challenge/pull/12/files)

**Something you learned from their attempt:**

How to recursively solve the challenge.

**Something you think they did well:**

Smartly using recursion.

**Something you think could be more in line with the four rules of simple design**

The indentation of the code since all the rest is perfect.

**Now, redo your most difficult challenge. Focus on the applying the things you learned from the review you did as well as the four rules of simple design:**

See [My new version based on recursion](https://github.com/sf-copperheads-2016/algorithm-drill-binary-search-challenge/pull/12/files)

**Once you have re-completed the review challenge, answer the following questions:**

- **How did reviewing other peoples code impact your second attempt?** Make it easier with recursion.

- **What questions did you dive into when reviewing the other code?** How to use recursion to solve a problem using less of the computer memeory. How usefull it is to declare default arguments when creating a recursive method.

- **Did you run into any dead ends that you don't understand? Enumerate 2 or 3 of the dead ends you dove into.** I think I got it even if it will require some practice for me to be able to come up myself with that kind of semantic to solve this kind of problems.

### About Sudoku search: Reviewing edella2

Based on [edella2 & markjanzer sudoku code](https://github.com/sf-copperheads-2016/sudoku-challenge/pull/8/files)

**Something you learned from their attempt:**

Some people have definitly a better logic than I do when it comes to write algorythms.

**Something you think they did well:**

Using an hash that uses arrays of two elements ( y, x ) to work from coordinates of every cell.

**Something you think could be more in line with the four rules of simple design**

Splitting the code into small methods and use a controller instead of one file.

- **How did reviewing other peoples code impact your second attempt?** Since I decided to rework the sudoku challenge, I realised it was plenty different ways to create the solver method.

- **What questions did you dive into when reviewing the other code?** Nested data structures manipulation, defining an hash and an hash key in order to store coordinates. Woop Woop!

- **Did you run into any dead ends that you don't understand? Enumerate 2 or 3 of the dead ends you dove into.** To be honest, I think I have a very good grasp on language syntax because i'm truely interested of learning different ways to solve one semantic. Also, my typographic background makes me very sensible to code design but I'm lacking some sense of the semantics to find the apropriate logic to solve complex problems like the sudoku. I had to SUDOKODE a lot to finally get it...
